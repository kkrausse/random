# Source provenance

Compatibility target: published OpenCode **2.0.3**, upstream tag revision
**d44b52ca66b6bf69626c0384626d1a9cd9555977**. This is an explicit release
protocol pin, not a claim of compatibility with arbitrary V2 releases.

Adapted against candidate `packages/core/src/session/message-updater.ts`: inbox delivery triggers authoritative history recovery instead of inventing messages, streamed timestamps and terminal provider state are retained, failed-tool metadata is self-contained, compaction metadata is retained. |

`src/api.ts` derives from this repository's `chat-client-demo/src/api.ts`:
same injected string-only endpoint URL resolution, pagination, model-catalog
activation and SSE parser. Replaced workspace imports and minimal hand-written
message/event types with the pinned native contract; formatted the local copy. No code from the Solid UI,
private packages, fonts or media is included. Markdown rendering is locally
authored with Marked 17.0.4 tokenization and React escaping; upstream Markdown
helpers were reviewed but not copied.

The React bundle includes the Marked tokenizer. Its complete Marked/Markdown
notices from `marked@17.0.4/LICENSE.md` are distributed as `LICENSE.marked`.

## 2.0.3 release audit (September 15)

Compared the complete generated contract against beta-19425. Changes add idle
history records, session permission rules/events, session diffs, file-not-found
errors and preferences APIs. Existing session, prompt, message, model, form,
permission-reply and event payloads used by this client remain compatible.
Authoritative history recovery retains the new idle records; the generic transcript
renderer displays them. New preferences/session-rule editing APIs are not exposed
as UI controls. The generated contract SHA-256 is
`9238842bf9d4dbef486f4c20fb4051a5ccb051a30a9d84a9d4267c089ef37fed`.

The server now builds from frozen published packages, with explicit archive
integrity instead of a claimed clean source checkout. The existing jsonc-parser
ESM selection remains; application/dependency source and emitted bytes are not
rewritten. See [the release acceptance](../doc/opencode-2.0.3-upgrade.md) for real
model/tool/browser retention checks and the beta-to-release database migration.

## Historical beta-19425 protocol audit

The retained source is authoritative for wire shapes. Public V2 client and API
guides were consulted on 2026-09-11:
<https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/build/client> and <https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/api>.
The previous generated `src/vendor/types.ts` SHA-256 was
`c3542397d6c1e208e6decbc9105a63499bfa5969c02ce28d204308151c16c7c0`.

Verified candidate `packages/protocol/src/groups/{session,model,plugin,form,permission,event}.ts`,
generated client types, server model/plugin handlers, core catalog, and core
session message updater. Session list/create, message cursor pages, active-session
maps, `{model:{providerID,id}}`, text prompts, permission replies and SSE envelopes
retain the shapes used here. Prompt responses now describe inbox items and are
not interpreted as messages. Interrupt returns `{interrupted}`; execution state
still comes from events plus authoritative active-session hydration.

Catalog reads no longer await activation: the client now explicitly posts to
`plugin/await-activation?location[directory]=...` before listing models. This waits
for settlement, not a guarantee that every configured plugin succeeded.

Legacy question HTTP routes/events are removed. Hydration uses `session/{id}/form`;
events use nested `form.created.data.form` and `form.replied` / `form.cancelled`.
`src/forms.ts` explicitly adapts the question tool's `metadata.kind = "question"`
projection from candidate `packages/core/src/tool/plugin/question.ts`: sequential
`q0...` string/multiselect fields with label-valued options. The public
`questions`, `replyQuestion(id, string[][])`, and `rejectQuestion(id)` API is kept:
replies post `{answer:{q0:string|string[],...}}` to `/form/{id}/reply`, and rejection
posts without a body to `/form/{id}/cancel`. The old public `QuestionRequest` view
is now package-owned rather than misrepresented as a candidate native type.

Arbitrary forms (including numeric, boolean, external, conditional, constrained,
or differently keyed/value-mapped forms) are exposed in `unsupportedForms` and
visibly explain that another compatible client is needed. They are never silently
dropped or submitted through the question adapter. HTTP failures, including 404,
remain failures. No legacy endpoint probing/fallback is performed.

The generated contract changed beyond forms (inbox, streamed/provider metadata,
optional terminal tool metadata, compaction provider context). It was replaced
only after reviewing these differences. Durable `session.message.content.updated`
is not in the candidate live `V2Event` union, so no unsupported SSE handler is
invented. History hydration remains authoritative for persisted messages.

The source audit and acceptance rationale are in the owning repository's
`browser-container-poc/doc/opencode-chat-ui-audit/`. This package does not depend
on those files at runtime or during its build.
# Package-owned UI primitives

`src/components/ui` adapts shadcn/ui's MIT-licensed **Base UI** registry
(`base-nova/button`, `select`, `input`, and `textarea`) into compact local
components. Registry source: <https://ui.shadcn.com/r/styles/base-nova/button.json>
and its sibling component URLs. See `LICENSE.shadcn`.

Buttons, selects, text inputs, radio groups, and checkboxes use `@base-ui/react`;
the textarea follows shadcn's native-element implementation. Lucide supplies
select/checkbox indicators. CVA, clsx, and tailwind-merge compose variants.
These implementation dependencies are bundled into the UI subpaths, with
their dependency licenses shipped in `dist/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt`.
React and React DOM stay external optional peers. Tailwind 4 is build-time only;
the distributed stylesheets contain compiled, namespaced component utilities.
