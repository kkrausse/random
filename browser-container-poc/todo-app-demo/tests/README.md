# Combined editor browser acceptance (prepared, not run)

`editor-acceptance.js` is a Browser Control execute body, prepared against the
current `todo-app-demo/src/{home,editing,editor-panel}.tsx` and
`opencode-chat/src/{editor,react,types}.tsx` / vendor types. It has **not been run
in a browser**. Preparation/runtime/OpenCode migration is coordinated by the parent;
this file does not launch, rebuild, navigate, reset storage, or select its session.
Historical context: `../../doc/editor-package-acceptance.md` and the bounded
document-identity check in `../../hybrid-fs/scripts/hmr-browser.js`.
Candidate protocol was also checked against the refreshed generated vendor types,
`vendor/reducer.ts` (`session.tool.called/success` → native tool objects), and the
retained beta-19425 source at `server-process-candidate.0co24kti/.runtime/opencode-v2-source`:
`packages/core/src/tool/plugin/shell.ts`, plus `shell/result.ts` and the native edit
input schema. The candidate uses **shell**, not the older **bash** tool name.

## Launch through the Bun-backed CLI only

Use the parent's agreed Bun-backed `browser-control` installation. No MCP, direct
Playwright connection, or alternative browser driver. Do not use the parent's
`lucky-tiger-637` session from a child agent. The parent may choose its own session
for the eventual real run. Commands below use `SESSION` as an explicit placeholder.

After the parent prepares/builds/launches the app and deliberately navigates its
chosen page to the exact URL, configure once (absolute evidence directory outside
tracked sources; receipts can contain demo source, todo titles, tool inputs/output):

```sh
bunx --bun browser-control execute --session SESSION 'state.editorAcceptanceConfig = { url: "http://127.0.0.1:4390/", evidenceDir: "/absolute/private/editor-acceptance", phase: "startup" }; return await snapshot()'
bunx --bun browser-control execute --session SESSION --file browser-container-poc/todo-app-demo/tests/editor-acceptance.js

# Select each subsequent phase, then execute the same file:
bunx --bun browser-control execute --session SESSION 'state.editorAcceptanceConfig.phase = "open"; return {phase: state.editorAcceptanceConfig.phase}'
bunx --bun browser-control execute --session SESSION --file browser-container-poc/todo-app-demo/tests/editor-acceptance.js
```

Run from the repository root or use an absolute script path. Do not run the file
as `bun tests/editor-acceptance.js`: `page`, `state`, `snapshot`, `fs`, and `path`
are injected by Browser Control. `sourcePath` defaults to `/src/home.tsx` and
`headingFrom` to `Todos`. Change them only after inspecting the actual source.

Each invocation inspects DOM first, performs one phase, inspects again, and writes
a uniquely named JSON receipt. State and JSHandles preserve exact document and
controller identity across phases without installing production hooks or globals.
Filesystem reads call the real `workspace.fs.readFile` via a read-only controller
handle obtained from the controlled React DOM ancestry. Missing/minified/changed
React shapes block rather than selecting a guessed API. No callbacks or hook state
are modified. Expanding a tool `<details>` is the only DOM-only UI action.

Receipts have `PASS`, `SUBMITTED`, `PENDING`, `BLOCKED`, or `OBSERVED` status.
**CLI success is not phase success**: assertion failures are captured as `BLOCKED`
so diagnostics survive. Consumers must check `value.status` (CLI `--json`) or the
artifact's `status`. There is no aggregate PASS. A `PASS` applies only to the named
phase. Source flush means local workspace persistence, not remote publication.

## Phase order and evidence

| Phase | Action / required proof |
| --- | --- |
| `startup` | Admin launcher enabled, normal todo UI ready, editor/preview absent; retain normal document/main identity and independently query host todos. Run before opening. |
| `open` | Click launcher once; returns SUBMITTED. |
| `ready` | Observe actual workspace lifecycle, both Vite/chat clients ready, real chat connected, enabled iframe todo form; normal app stays mounted in same host document. Repeat while PENDING. |
| `crud-add` | Add uniquely named owned todo inside iframe; independently GET host `/api/getTodos` and retain its ID. |
| `crud-toggle` | Check owned todo in iframe; independently prove host `completed:true`. Safe to repeat while PENDING. |
| `crud-delete` | Delete only that exact owned title/ID and prove absence from host API. No broad cleanup. |
| `source-open` | Open Source; current textarea must equal independent `/src/home.tsx` bytes. |
| `hmr-edit` | Capture original bytes and preview document; fill textarea with one h1 edit, no explicit save/flush. SUBMITTED. |
| `hmr-verify` | Exact independently read bytes + explicit local flush UI status + changed heading + same preview Document. Repeat while PENDING. |
| parent coordination | Inspect chat and choose **New chat** if no selected session. Select a real tool-capable model if required. Harness does not silently create extra sessions or select a guessed model. |
| `model-send` | Submit genuine read + minimal edit prompt once, storing prior session/message/tool IDs first. |
| `model-verify` | New user message in same session, idle execution, completed assistant, new native read/edit tools targeting exact file, `executed:false` (local), ran/completed timestamps, correlated edit old/new strings, exact independent source bytes, changed heading, same preview Document. No model prose is used as evidence. |
| `file-link` | Open actual tool file button and compare textarea with independently read edited file. |
| `shell-send` | Ask for native built-in `shell` running an exact `printf` command once, foreground with timeout 8000ms. |
| `shell-verify` | Correlate sole new native local tool to same session and exact command; require completed status/timestamps, numeric `metadata.exit === 0`, non-truncated completed metadata, first text content equal to exact stdout including newline, second text content equal to the candidate's exit notice. Unknown contracts BLOCK. |
| `close` | Capture session/message IDs, exact source, and live lifecycle handle; click Exit only when chat idle. |
| `closed` | Retained controller reports no workspace/runtime/services, persistence closed; iframe detached, normal main retained, launcher enabled; captured pre-close service executions have exited and output drains joined (record exitCode/signal/forced). Repeat while PENDING. |
| `reopen` | Click launcher once; then run `ready` and `source-open` again. |
| `retention` | Compare independent full source bytes and original session/message IDs plus stable conversation content/native tool records after reopen. If prior chat isn't auto-selected, parent must select it via inspected UI; load earlier messages if paginated, then retry. |
| `inspect` | Observation-only snapshot/status/activity receipt at any point. |

Actions/waits are limited to 8 seconds; `ready` and turn verification take short
observations rather than monopolizing a long execute. Workspace reads and host API
requests also have 8-second bounds. A PENDING result is **not** a pass. Parent should
set an overall deadline (suggestion: 180s startup, 30s autosave/HMR, 180s model/shell,
60s cleanup) and stop with the latest diagnostic receipt when exceeded. Browser
context evaluation itself remains subject to the CLI's transport timeout.

Do not automatically rerun action phases after a timeout: inspect the existing
todo/source/turn first. Send intents are stored before clicking to prevent duplicate
model submissions. Preserve the Browser Control journal and all JSON receipts.
On a relay restart, `state`/handles are lost: old disk receipts remain evidence,
but cross-phase document identity can no longer be established. Start a new
explicit baseline rather than manufacturing identity from old timestamps. A reload
also invalidates same-document evidence; there is intentionally no automatic reload.

## Additional coordinated cases / limitations

- **Startup cancellation:** use a separate run/baseline; `startup`, `open`, then
  `cancel-startup` while actual controller `busy` is true, followed by `closed`.
  If startup already settled, cancellation is BLOCKED, not a pass. Parent coordinates
  reopening and readiness afterward. Closed lifecycle evidence proves controller
  cleanup and joins captured service exit/drain promises; it is not independent
  OS/worker leak instrumentation or a claim that shutdown was natural exit 0.
  Startup cancellation may occur before services exist; its captured list can be
  empty and does not establish cleanup of a fully running editor.
- **Strict new Tailwind utility:** after `source-open`, run `tailwind-baseline`.
  Parent first verifies the utility is absent from the entire prepared source/CSS
  graph (the script checks only target source and initial computed value). Through
  the inspected source textarea add `className="tracking-[7px]"` to the h1, preserving
  its text and other code; wait for local autosave. Run `tailwind-verify`: independent
  source inclusion, same Document, rendered class, and computed `letter-spacing:7px`
  must all hold. Config override: `tailwind: {utility, property, value}`. A class in
  source/DOM alone never passes. Run this after retention or preserve the amended
  retention baseline deliberately; do not perturb model's exact-one-edit comparison.
- **Shell migration blocker:** extraction follows beta-19425's real `toolResult`
  and `ShellResult.metadata/notice`: first content item is combined process capture,
  second is the tool-generated notice. For this stdout-only `printf`, capture must
  equal exact expected stdout. This does not independently qualify stderr separation.
  Do not accept a model-authored “exit 0,” a custom JS stand-in, shell-looking prose,
  or normalize away banners/truncation. Missing metadata, failure to launch the
  platform shell, or different native payloads retain BLOCKED for parent diagnosis.
- **Forms migration:** no `/question` endpoint is called. Permissions, the current
  question UI's form projection, unsupported forms, or a future native `forms` array
  stop verification for parent coordination. Unsupported forms must never be ignored
  to manufacture an idle/pass result.
- **Tool migration:** current ToolCard only exposes file links for `input.path` or
  `input.filePath`. Patch formats that embed paths solely inside a patch string are
  deliberately not inferred. Inspect migrated tool schema before extending target
  correlation; a completed unrelated tool must never satisfy model-edit acceptance.
- **Backend reload persistence:** CRUD already cross-checks real host state from
  outside the iframe, but does not reload the host. Parent can run a separate normal
  app create/toggle/reload flow; do not interleave reload with HMR document handles.
- **Authorization and lazy graph:** startup DOM checks do not establish absence of
  eager runtime downloads, nor unauthorized asset/model denial. Parent must collect
  pre-navigation network evidence on a separate non-admin fixture and inspect the
  prepared bundle graph. Record exact preparation/runtime/OpenCode hashes alongside
  receipts; this harness cannot infer which build the launcher serves.
- **Restoration:** original source is in `state.editorAcceptance.hmr.original` and
  the HMR/source receipts. After collecting retention evidence, parent may restore
  it through inspected **File contents**, wait for autosave, and use **Reload file**
  plus independent read to verify. Preserve any later user edits; no automatic full
  source reset, conversation deletion, storage clearing, or server restart occurs.

Preparation validation is syntax-only with Bun's `AsyncFunction` parser. Browser
acceptance, locator compatibility, model capability, shell output contract, and
Tailwind behavior must be established by the parent's actual run.
