# agent-dash design

Layers, bottom up:

```
machine helpers (machines.ts)    on() · forward() · exec/sh/lines · shared ssh connection
harness streams                  claude.ts (host loop) · opencode.ts · codex.ts
sources / store (store.ts)       one supervised fiber per machine × harness → Solid store
UI (list.tsx, new-session.tsx,   Solid + OpenTUI; an open session is the harness CLI in a PTY
    main.tsx)
```

Effect is used for the source side only (streams, scoped resources, retry
schedules, Schema decoding). The store is the bridge: each stream item replaces
that source's rows in a Solid store; the UI never sees Effect.

## Machines

A machine is `{ id, ssh?, dir?, path? }` from `~/.config/agent-dash/machines.json`.
There is no machine service, just two helpers:

- `on(machine, cmd, { cwd?, tty? })`: `cmd` unchanged locally; remotely an
  `ssh` argv running `PATH=<path entries>:~/.local/bin:~/.bun/bin:~/.opencode/bin:$PATH;
  cd <cwd> && exec <cmd>` (shell-quoted, `~` expanded on the host; `-t` for
  panes, `-T -o BatchMode=yes` otherwise).
- `forward(machine, target)`: local address unchanged; remotely `ssh -O forward
  -L` on the shared connection (a free local TCP port, or a local Unix socket
  for Codex pointing at the remote absolute path, resolved from the remote
  `$HOME`), with `ssh -O cancel` when the Effect scope closes.

### SSH channel model

Every ssh uses `ControlMaster=auto`, `ControlPath=~/.local/state/agent-dash/ssh/%C`
(mode 700; falls back to `/tmp/agent-dash-<uid>` if that path would exceed the
~104 byte Unix socket limit) and `ControlPersist=10m`. The master is opened once
per host under a semaphore, so one TCP connection per host carries:

- the host loop (one long-lived session),
- short commands (`cat service.json`, socket checks, archive writes, `claude --bg`),
- port/socket forwards (OpenCode SSE + requests, Codex RPC; these are channels,
  not sessions),
- each open pane (one session each).

sshd's `MaxSessions` (default 10) caps sessions per connection. A pane refused for
that reason prints a message saying so. Quitting interrupts every source (which
cancels forwards) and runs `ssh -O exit` for each host.

## Harness streams

Each source emits the complete current list on every item.

| Harness | Mechanism | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | one POSIX `sh` loop per host printing a framed record every 2 s, and on demand (a line on its stdin) | no subscribe API; remotes may have only `sh` (no jq/python/bun) |
| OpenCode 2.x | `/api/event` SSE; relevant events (session.*, permission.*, form.*) trigger a re-list; 60 s resync | the server has an event stream |
| Codex | app-server notifications (`thread/started`, `thread/status/changed`, `thread/archived`, ...) trigger a re-list; 60 s resync | the daemon broadcasts thread notifications to every client |

Triggers arriving while a list is in flight collapse into one more list
(`Stream.buffer` sliding, capacity 1).

### Claude host loop

Frames, one record per tick:

```
@@archive
<~/.config/agent-dash/archive.json>
@@claude <exit code> | @@claude missing
<claude agents --json --all>
@@job <id> <mtime>          followed by state.json, or
@@job <id> <mtime> same     when unchanged since the last tick
@@end
```

A ticker subshell and the loop's stdin feed one pipe, and each line on it is one record, so the
dashboard gets a record at once by writing a newline. It does that when you leave a session pane
(a prompt you just sent shows as working without waiting for the tick) and after `claude stop`.
The loop emits every tick even when nothing changed; no record for ~3 ticks fails
the stream and the supervisor restarts the command. Local uses the same loop. A
host without `claude` still runs it for its archive marks. The Paseo check (local
`ps`) only runs for the local machine.

### OpenCode

`cat` of `service.json` via `on`, plus `opencode --version` and a `kill -0` of its
pid on that host. CLI missing → not installed; CLI 1.x → unsupported (different
API); no file or dead pid → not running (stale). Then `forward` to the host:port
the url names (the Mac's service binds its Tailscale address, not loopback).

### Codex

`[ -S ~/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock ]` on the host, forward
the socket, keep the existing hand-framed WebSocket JSON-RPC (`CodexRpc`).

## Sources and store

A source is machine × harness, keyed `machine/harness`. Its state is rows plus an
optional problem. Each source runs under `supervise`: a stream that ends or fails
records the problem and is retried, every 60 s for quiet problems (missing,
unsupported, stopped) and with exponential backoff capped at 30 s for real ones
(unreachable, decode, failed). Real failures keep the last rows on screen.
All external JSON (claude agents output, state.json, archive.json, OpenCode and
Codex responses) is decoded with `Schema`, so format drift is a per-source error.

## Session model

`{ machine, harness, key = machine/harness:id, id, title, cwd, open?: {cmd, cwd},
closedReason?, status, prompted?, detail, updatedAt, model, archived }`. `open.cmd` is
machine-agnostic; the pane wraps it with `on(machine, cmd, { cwd, tty: true })`.
Status: `needs | working | done | failed | interrupted | idle` (idle = never
prompted, e.g. a fresh `claude --bg`). A new session's claim is data:
`{ id }` (Claude) or `{ firstNewIn: dir }` (OpenCode/Codex).

`prompted` is independent of status: false means a known empty draft; absent
means unknown (do not hide it). Claude recognises its initial "send a prompt"
state, Codex supplies the first-prompt preview, and OpenCode checks for a user
message on idle sessions without an outcome (cached by update time). Live
activity also confirms a chat has started. Claiming a session ID does not.
The source confirms the first prompt; pressing Enter in a model picker is not
enough. Known drafts stay hidden even after their client is closed; nothing is
deleted or archived.

### Optional metrics

`subagents?: { total, active, complete }` counts all descendants, like the
session-manager plugin. OpenCode and Codex retain parent links while summarising
their native lists, then emit only roots. Codex explicitly requests subagent source
kinds (the API defaults to interactive threads only). Both follow pagination, capped
at 10 pages per list; incomplete scans render counts as lower bounds (`≥N`). Cycle
and duplicate-ID guards prevent double-counting. These are compact badges, not an
expandable child tree yet; not every child necessarily has an attachable CLI.

`context?: { usedTokens, limitTokens?, measuredAt }` is a latest-response snapshot,
not cumulative billed tokens. OpenCode uses the newest assistant usage after the
last completed compaction and before any revert boundary, matching the plugin's
formula (input + output + reasoning + cache read + cache write). It fetches the
newest 100 messages for active roots and refreshes previously observed roots when
they change. A revert boundary outside that page means unavailable. Model limits
are resolved in the session's location and cached for 60 seconds. Optional lookups
are bounded, time out, and fail independently of the basic list.

Codex takes `last.totalTokens`, never cumulative `total`, from received
`thread/tokenUsage/updated` events and uses `modelContextWindow` when available.
The connection keeps snapshots in memory; it does not resume threads or otherwise
mutate them to acquire a subscription. Initial availability and live event delivery
depend on the server's notification behavior.

Claude has no API for either, so the host loop reads them off disk. For each listed
session it finds `~/.claude/projects/*/<sessionId>.jsonl`, sends the last line of the
transcript's tail that is a response's usage or a compaction boundary (only when the
file's mtime changes), and counts `<sessionId>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`. Context is
that response's `input + cache_creation + cache_read` tokens, matching Claude's own
status line (output tokens are not counted, unlike OpenCode). A compaction boundary
doesn't decode as usage, so context is unavailable until the next response. The window
is not recorded anywhere readable (the model id carries no `[1m]` marker even when
usage reaches 500k), so Claude rows have no `limitTokens`. The exact figure is only
handed to a status-line script, which would need a per-host opt-in bridge. Subagent total is the
transcript count (nested ones land in the same folder); active is the job state's
`fan` entries of kind `agent` without `doneAt`, so it is 0 for interactive sessions.

The list shows tokens used, not a percentage, for every harness: one harness can't
supply a limit, and a column mixing shares and counts doesn't read as a column.
Missing means unavailable, not zero. The footer shows exact tokens, the limit when
the harness reports one, and measurement age. Future providers can
leave either metric absent without changing the UI contract.

## Stop

One verb per harness that ends whatever is still running, so nothing starts again unprompted.
`Session.stoppable` says whether there is anything to end. Claude sessions can wake themselves
(`/loop`, scheduled wakeups), and a finished background session keeps its process, so every
background session is stoppable until its state is `stopped`/`killed`; `claude stop` runs over
`exec` like any short command, and "No job matching" counts as already stopped. Codex and
OpenCode never wake on their own, so stopping is interrupting the running turn (stoppable =
active). They need the source's live connection (the RPC socket, the forwarded API), so each of
those streams publishes a stop function to the store while connected (`setStop`, released with
the stream's scope); stopping while a source is disconnected fails.

## Archive

Archived = harness archive, OR a dashboard mark, OR (not needs/working and
`updatedAt` older than 7 days) unless explicitly restored. Marks live on each host in
`~/.config/agent-dash/archive.json` as `{ "harness:id": true | false }` (false =
explicit restore). `x`/`r` read, modify and replace the file on that host with a
POSIX `sh` write (temp file + `mv`); `x` stops the session first and only marks it if the stop succeeded. Last writer wins between two dashboards
archiving at the same moment. Every dashboard reads the file through that host's
loop record.

## UI

Sections Working → Needs input → Finished → Archived (collapsed). Order within a
section is frozen once every source answered (or after 5 s); live updates move
badges and sections, never positions within a section. Working is the exception:
it is ordered by when each session was first seen working, so a newly working
session joins its bottom.

An open session owns the real terminal (`passthrough.ts`). The dashboard suspends
its renderer and copies bytes both ways without an emulator in between, because
OpenTUI's embedded terminal drops what it doesn't model (OSC 8 links, OSC 52).
Two things are kept on the side from the same output stream. A hidden emulator,
never drawn, tells whether the cursor sits at an empty prompt, which is what makes
← leave the session; its query replies are discarded since the real terminal
answers the harness. A record of the terminal modes the harness switched on
(private modes, kitty keyboard flags, modifyOtherKeys) is undone when returning to
the list and re-applied on reopening. A hidden client is kept one row short, so
reopening is a real resize and the harness repaints itself. Clients not shown for 15
minutes are closed (agents keep running in their daemons).
