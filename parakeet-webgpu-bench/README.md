# Parakeet 0.6b on native WebGPU runtimes vs the dictation service

How fast does NVIDIA Parakeet 0.6b run through a native (non-browser) WebGPU runtime on diesel2
(RTX 2080 Ti, driver 580, 12 cores), compared with what `../dictation-server-linux` uses today
(transcribe.cpp 0.3.1, ggml, Vulkan)? Measured 2026-10-09. Benchmark code only. The same model in
an actual browser (Chrome, onnxruntime-web) is in [In the browser](#in-the-browser), added the next day.

Short answer: ONNX Runtime's WebGPU provider (Dawn on Vulkan) works and really runs on the GPU, at
40–100x real time depending on clip length. transcribe.cpp on Vulkan is 2–3x faster on the
encoder, is ready 2.5–3.5x sooner and is what the service already has. Burn on wgpu imports and runs the encoder
correctly but is 10x slower than ONNX Runtime WebGPU.

## Results

Same model everywhere unless noted: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`, as istupakov's ONNX export (fp32) and
handy-computer's GGUF. Same three clips, raw 16 kHz mono f32: the first 7.0 s of the service's
LibriSpeech fixture, the whole 13.7 s fixture, and transcribe.cpp's `product-names.wav` (56.1 s).
One discarded warm-up, then 10 runs; cells are **median / worst** in ms. "enc" is the encoder
alone, "total" is mel + encoder + decode for the whole clip.

| transcribe.cpp Vulkan, unified F16 | 2.6 s | 92 ms (38) | 1190 / 1213 MiB | 272 MiB |

Peak is over all three clips; the 56 s clip sets it. Load times are from a warm page cache and
vary a lot with what else is reading the disk (the two F16 GGUF rows differ only by that).

**Cold start and the on-disk pipeline cache.** Process start to the first transcript of the 7 s
clip, with NVIDIA's shader cache (`__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH`) emptied first, then three more
processes that find it:

| Runtime | Empty cache | Next three processes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| ORT WebGPU fp32 | 4.9 s (first run 746 ms) | 4.5, 4.5, 4.8 s (first run 230–270 ms) |
| ORT WebGPU fp16 | 3.7 s (first run 845 ms) | 3.1, 3.5, 4.1 s (first run 360–660 ms) |
| transcribe.cpp Vulkan, TDT F16 | 8.2 s (first run 6.8 s) | 1.4, 1.3, 1.3 s (first run 86–91 ms) |

The driver cache matters much less to ONNX Runtime (0.5 s) than to ggml (7 s), but ONNX Runtime
pays 200–600 ms on the first inference of every process regardless (Dawn rebuilds its pipelines;
ORT has no pipeline cache of its own on disk), and session creation, not shaders, is its long pole.

**The service's unit of work** (unified F16, buffered streaming: 5.6 s left + 560 ms chunk +
560 ms right, a ~6.7 s window per chunk, only the chunk's frames decoded):

- `tcpp_bench.py --stream`, own process, chunks fed back to back, quiet machine: median 46 ms,
  worst 93 ms per full-window chunk on the 13.7 s clip (14 chunks x 10 runs); 45 ms median, 346 ms
  worst on the 56 s clip. This reproduces the 46 ms in the service's README.
- The live service on :9876, from a client (`scripts/live.ts`), machine moderately busy: 49 ms
  median per full-window chunk back to back on the 7 s clip; 86 ms median (worst 553) on the
  13.7 s clip, and 177–199 ms when paced in real time. See the caveat on load below.
- ONNX Runtime WebGPU was not run as a streaming loop. Its cost for the same unit would be mel
  (about 8 ms) + a 7 s encoder pass (46–71 ms fp32, 58 ms fp16) + decoding seven frames on the CPU
  (a few ms): an estimate of 60–85 ms per chunk against 46 ms measured for transcribe.cpp.

### What ran where

- **ORT WebGPU encoder**: 1512 nodes on `WebGpuExecutionProvider` (all MatMul 289, Conv 77,
  LayerNormalization 120, Softmax 24, Add, Mul, Transpose, Reshape, Where, Pad, Slice, ...), 495 on
  `CPUExecutionProvider`. The CPU ones are the shape arithmetic ORT keeps on the CPU on purpose
  (Unsqueeze 176, Gather 150, Concat 101, Slice 26, Squeeze 24 and a handful of others on shape
  tensors); they take about 5 ms per run in the profile. No silent fallback: the process holds
  2.4 GB of GPU memory in `nvidia-smi` and the encoder is 6–18x faster than the CPU provider.
  With the fp16 encoder: 1490 on WebGPU, 495 on CPU, 1.2 GB.
- **Decoder + joint** (26 nodes): all on CPU by default. Placed on WebGPU, all 26 run there and it
  is about 4x slower end to end (7 ms per token step instead of 1–2 ms), because greedy TDT
  decoding is one tiny session run and GPU read-back per token.
- **Mel front end** (`nemo128.onnx`, 35 nodes): CPU in every ORT row.
- **transcribe.cpp**: everything on `Vulkan0`, including the per-token decoder; mel on CPU.
- Encoder time on ORT WebGPU grows slowly with length (71 ms for 7 s, 265 ms for 56 s) and fp16
  barely helps: at short lengths it is bound by dispatching ~1500 kernels, not by GPU arithmetic.
  The fp32 encoder is also faster (46 vs 71 ms at 7 s) when the decoder keeps the GPU busy between
  encoder runs; cause not established (the same idle-GPU effect the service README notes).

### Transcripts

All TDT v2 rows (ORT WebGPU fp32 and fp16, ORT WebGPU decoder, ORT CPU, transcribe.cpp F16 and F32)
give byte-identical text on all three clips, stable across runs:

The unified model (a different model, the one the service runs) says "draughty" for "drafty",
"Quirk Quid Quill Inc.", and offline drops the punctuation of the 13.7 s clip; streaming, it gives
the service's usual text. Burn's encoder output matches ORT CPU to 2e-4 absolute (values up to
0.8) on all three clips; it was not decoded to text.

### Not like for like, not measured, and failures

- **Machine load.** Other work (Rust and C++ builds, several Chrome instances) had 5–10 of the 12
  cores busy for most of the session. The tables above are from a pass taken while it was quiet
  (`results/machine-load.txt` has the CPU pressure at the start of each row, and the last line for a
  name is the run that is in `results/`; the tcpp rows are from 22:49–22:51, the ORT and Burn rows
  from 22:51–22:56). `bench.sh` runs the benchmarks in a
  high-weight systemd slice, which helps but does not isolate them. CPU-bound numbers (ORT CPU,
  decoder times, load times, worst cases) are the least reliable.
- **`scripts/measure.ts` of the service did not give usable numbers.** Run twice on a spare port
  (it starts its own instance, it does not touch :9876) while the machine was loaded: ready in
  1.5–2.2 s, 2.2–6.2 s wall per 13.7 s recording, then the 192 s real-time recording failed with
  `AssertionError: overload` both times. Output is in `results/service-measure.txt`. The service
  README's own figures (ready 1.0–1.1 s, 106 ms per chunk in real time) were taken on a quiet
  machine and were not reproduced here; the real-time figures from `live.ts` above are inflated by
  the same load.
- **Service vs ORT is two models.** The service runs `parakeet-unified-en-0.6b` with a chunked
  attention mask; the ORT and Burn rows are `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`. Same 0.6b FastConformer encoder
  size; the transcribe.cpp TDT rows are the like-for-like comparison, and the unified offline row
  shows the two models cost the same in transcribe.cpp.
- **Precision.** ORT fp32 against GGUF F32 and ORT fp16 against GGUF F16 are the matched pairs. The
  fp16 ONNX is my conversion (`scripts/onnx-fp16.py`), not a published file.
- **transcribe.cpp stage times** (mel/encode/decode) are the library's own `transcribe_get_timings`;
  totals are wall time around `transcribe_run` including reading the text back. ORT and Burn times
  are wall time around calls that return CPU tensors.
- **ORT CUDA was not run** (needs 2.6 GB of CUDA 13 and cuDNN 9 libraries that are no longer on the
  box). The earlier spike measured it on the unified model: 25 ms per chunk fp32, 17–19 ms fp16,
  3.4 / 2.4 GB (`../dictation-server-linux/README.md`).
- **ORT WebGPU segfaults at process exit** (ORT 1.28 + Dawn teardown, after all results are
  printed; `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`, exit 139). `ort-bench` leaves through `_exit`.
- **Burn**: nothing blocked. `onnx2burn` imported all operators of the fp32 encoder (64 s, 2.5 GB
  `.bpk`), the generated code compiled, and the output is correct. It is simply slow: 474–543 ms
  for the 7 s window, 7–10x ORT WebGPU, with 2.5–3.9 GB of GPU memory. Both builds report the
  device fingerprint `spirv_4318_7687`, so I cannot confirm from the output that the `wgpu`-feature
  build used WGSL shaders; the two builds do differ in speed and memory. Encoder only: no mel
  front end or decoder was ported, and fp16 was not tried.
- Not measured: word error rate, a streaming loop on ORT WebGPU, cold-disk start, the WebGPU EP's
  options (graph capture, buffer cache modes, layout), wgpu directly without Burn.

## In the browser

Added 2026-10-10: the same model in real Chrome 154 on this machine, through `onnxruntime-web`
1.30.0 (npm has no 1.28), from a static page in `web/`. Headed Chrome on its own Xvfb display,
WebGPU on Vulkan. Same three clips, one discarded warm-up, 10 warm runs, median / worst in ms.
Every `session.run()` resolves to CPU tensors, so the times include the read-back.

Short answer: it works and it is on the 2080 Ti. The fp32 encoder is 20–80% slower than native
ONNX Runtime WebGPU measured in the same window (90 vs 50 ms for 7 s, 314 vs 262 ms for 56 s) and
the whole transcribe is 30–60% slower, at 40–63x real time. It costs far more memory than native:
the renderer keeps 2.4 GB (fp16) or 4.4 GB (fp32) of RSS on top of the GPU memory, where the
native process holds 0.4 GB. The fp16 encoder does not load in stock Chrome on this driver. All
on WASM, the int8 export runs at 3x real time on one thread and 7–8x on four.

GPU memory is what `nvidia-smi` charges to Chrome's GPU process; RSS is from `/proc`. Each row is a
new Chrome with an empty profile, so "first" has no Chrome shader cache (NVIDIA's own driver cache
in `~/.cache/nvidia` was warm). Page start to first transcript of the 7 s clip, files served from
localhost: 16.7 s fp32, 8.0 s fp16, 7.7–9.5 s int8 on WASM. The native session-creation times of
this window are 3–4x the 9 October ones: weights were being read from disk again, not a regression.

### What was really in use

- **Adapter**: `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()` reports vendor `nvidia`, architecture `turing`,
  and with `--enable-webgpu-developer-features` device `0x1e07`, "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti",
  `isFallbackAdapter` false. `chrome://gpu` data: `ANGLE (NVIDIA, Vulkan 1.4.312 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX
  2080 Ti), NVIDIA-580.178.4.0)`, WebGPU and Vulkan enabled. Chrome's GPU process holds 2.4 GB
  (fp32) or 1.2 GB (fp16) in `nvidia-smi`, the same as the native process. Not SwiftShader or llvmpipe.
- **Chrome flags** that were needed: `--enable-unsafe-webgpu --ignore-gpu-blocklist
  --enable-features=Vulkan --use-angle=vulkan`. Linux WebGPU is not on by default in Chrome 154.
- **`shader-f16` is absent in stock Chrome on this driver.** Dawn gates f16 on NVIDIA Vulkan
  drivers older than 615.71 (this box has 580.178), and the fp16 encoder then fails at session
  creation with `ERROR_CODE: 1, ERROR_MESSAGE: shader_helper.cc:416 GenerateSourceCode Program
  Transpose requires f16 but the device does not support it.` The fp16 row was run with
  `--enable-dawn-features=vulkan_enable_f16_on_nvidia`; with it the feature appears and the
  transcripts are right. Native ORT 1.28 ships an older Dawn without that gate.
- **Runtime build**: `ort.webgpu.min.mjs` with `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm`, which is
  the C++ WebGPU provider compiled to WASM (the same provider as native). The JSEP row is the
  older provider written in JS (`ort.all.min.mjs`); warm speed is about the same, its first run
  is 3x slower.
- **Decoder + joint** on WASM, 4 threads: 1.1–1.4 ms per token step against 0.8–1.1 native. On
  WebGPU it is about 9 ms per step. On the 56 s clip the fp32 browser row is 218 ms behind native:
  96 ms of that is the decoder, 77 ms the mel front end, 52 ms the encoder.
- **Mel front end** is JS (`web/src/mel.ts`), 10–25 ms for 7 s and 80–150 ms for 56 s, against
  7 and 63 ms for `nemo128.onnx` native. onnxruntime-web cannot run `nemo128.onnx`: `Could not
  find an implementation for Cast(13) node with name 'node_Cast_6'` (a cast to float64). The JS
  version matches the dumped native features to 6e-6 (`bun web/check-mel.ts`).
- **int8 on WebGPU** is not a GPU run: the quantized operators have no WebGPU kernels, the
  encoder is slower than plain WASM and GPU memory stays near zero until the first run.
- **WASM threads** need `crossOriginIsolated`. `web/serve.ts` sends COOP/COEP; the published copy
  cannot (tailscale serve, no custom headers) and runs one thread unless the page's opt-in service
  worker is turned on.
- The 2.4 GB fp32 weights do not fit a JS `ArrayBuffer` in Chrome (`RangeError: Array buffer
  allocation failed`); the page reads files above 2 GB into a `WebAssembly.Memory` buffer.

### Transcripts in the browser

fp32 and fp16, on WebGPU (both builds), WASM and with the decoder on WebGPU: identical to the
native text on all three clips, stable over the warm runs. The int8 export is identical on the
7 s and 13.7 s clips and differs on the 56 s clip in five places (four on WebGPU), all in the
product names: "Quirk Quid Quill Inc.", "E3." for "E3 Equity.", "RAP Z", "U3 Unifund",
"QuirkQuid Quill Inc."

### Phone page

`https://raspberrypi.guineafowl-truck.ts.net/artifacts/parakeet-webgpu-browser/` (tailnet only,
https). Models are served from the same place: the shelf is a plain directory on the Pi behind
`tailscale serve` with 2.6 TB free and no size limit, so nothing is fetched from Hugging Face. It
opens idle with three one-tap configurations, smallest first: int8 all on WASM (631 MB), fp16 with
the encoder on WebGPU (1.25 GB), fp32 with the encoder on WebGPU (2.4 GB); each runs the 7 s clip
with 3 warm runs. Every finished step is written to the page and to `localStorage`, and a reload
lists earlier runs with the last step each one reached. Model files go to Cache Storage when the
quota allows, so a second attempt does not download again.

Checked from Chrome on diesel2 against the published link: int8 on WASM (one thread, 7 s clip in
2.1 s, renderer 2.3 GB RSS) and fp16 on WebGPU with the Dawn flag (encoder 61 ms) both load, run
and give the native transcript; the threads button turns `crossOriginIsolated` on. **Nothing was
run on a phone.** The desktop numbers that bear on it: the smallest configuration peaks at 2.3 GB
of renderer memory, and fp16 needs `shader-f16`.

### Browser: not measured, and caveats

- **Load.** A first pass ran with 20–35 runnable tasks on the 12 cores and is kept in
  `results/browser/pass1-loaded/` (fp32 encoder 138 ms at 7 s there). The tables are from a second
  pass at 01:28–01:45 with load average 8–9 falling to 4 and CPU pressure under 5%
  (`results/browser/machine-load.txt`), except "int8 on WebGPU", which is from the end of the first
  pass when it was already quiet. The int8 12- and 4-thread rows started quiet but something else
  began during them; 12 threads slower than 4 is that, or oversubscription. Other Chrome instances
  were using the GPU lightly throughout.
- The native rows were rerun in that window so each browser row has a neighbour under the same
  load; they came out faster at 7 s than on 9 October (50 vs 71 ms), so compare with those.
- onnxruntime-web 1.30.0 against native ORT 1.28: two versions apart.
- `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()` resolved before the end of the run in six of the
  nine rows (1.3–5.4 GB, in each JSON) and not in the fp32, fp16 and JSEP WebGPU rows.
  `performance.memory` JS heap is in each JSON too but excludes WASM memory, so RSS is the number
  to read.
- Not measured: any phone, Safari or Firefox; a Chrome with a warm shader cache (second visit);
  node placement in the browser; a streaming loop; WASM with more than 4 GB (the fp32 model fits,
  renderer 5.9 GB); `parakeet.js`; word error rate of int8 beyond the three clips.

## Layout

- `ort-bench/`: Rust, `ort` 2.0.0-rc.13 with the `webgpu` feature. Its prebuilt ONNX Runtime 1.28
  (static, plus `libwebgpu_dawn.so`) is downloaded at build time. Mel via the export's own
  `nemo128.onnx`, greedy TDT decode loop in `src/main.rs`.
- `burn-bench/`: Rust, Burn 0.22; includes the code `onnx2burn` generates into `cache/burn-gen/`.
- `scripts/tcpp_bench.py`: transcribe.cpp through ctypes, reusing `../dictation-server-linux/server.py`
  bindings and the libraries in that directory's `.cache` (read-only).
- `scripts/live.ts`: client timings against the running service. `scripts/placement.ts`: node
  placement from a verbose ORT log. `scripts/table.ts`: the tables above from `results/`.
- `web/`: the browser page (bun + TypeScript, no framework). `src/main.ts` and `src/mel.ts` are the
  page, `build.ts` writes `web/dist/` (page, onnxruntime-web files, clips, hard links to the models
  in `cache/`), `serve.ts` serves it with COOP/COEP, `drive.ts` runs one configuration in Chrome on
  Xvfb and writes `results/browser/<name>.json`, `bench.sh` runs the rows. `sw.js` is the opt-in
  service worker that gives a header-less host cross-origin isolation.
  `scripts/browser-table.ts` prints the browser tables.
- `cache` is a symlink to `~/devfs/cache/parakeet-webgpu-bench` (models, audio, build output; 15 GB).
